Add in some sauteed mushrooms, sneak in some spinach, or add some bell peppers, anything that catches your fancy and it will all taste great!

      <h2>Steps to make Microwaved Egg-Omelette-In-A-Mug</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>To make the Microwaved Egg-Omlette-In-A-Mug first grease 4 microwaveable cups with oil.</li>
        <li>Then, crack the eggs and add additional egg whites from 4 eggs into a mixing bowl. Add pepper powder, salt, finely chopped bell peppers and onions into the same bowl and whisk well until combined and frothy.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into the greased cups, equally, taking care to fill only 3/4 of the cup.</li>
        <li>One at a time, place the cups in the microwave and cook on high power for 2 minutes each. If you see the mix bubbling out of the cup, stop the microwave, remove the cup out and mix once, place it back into the microwave and cook.</li>
        <li>Insert a fork into the cup and if it comes out clean the omelette is cooked and ready. If the fork comes out eggy, you need to cook the egg for a minute or two more. Mix it once and place it back into the microwave. Cook until the fork comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Serve the Egg-Omelette-In-A-Mug along with some toast and Banana Almond & Prunes Smoothie for a hearty breakfast.</li>
