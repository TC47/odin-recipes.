    <h2>Steps to make Aloo Poha Recipe - Batata Poha</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>To begin making the Aloo Poha Recipe-Batata Poha Recipe, we will first rinse the poha or flattened rice under cold water and drain any excess water. Using a large strainer for washing helps ease the rinsing process. Transfer the rinsed rice to a large bowl; stir in the turmeric, salt, sugar, asafoetida and keep aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan on medium heat; add the mustard seeds, cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.</li>
        <li>Once the seeds have crackle stir in the onions, curry leaves, ginger, green chillies and sauté until the onions are tender and become translucent. Now stir in the potatoes and sauté for a couple of minutes till potatoes are cooked.</li>
        <li>Once done gradually stir in the flattened rice mixture into the onion and potato mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle about 3 tablespoons of water and gently stir to combine all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to low, cover the pan with a lid and let it simmer for 4-5 minutes. You will notice the flattened rice has fluffed up a little.</li>
        <li>Once the poha is done turn off heat and stir in the freshly squeezed lemon juice, steamed peas, roasted peanuts and chopped coriander leaves. Let the aloo poha sit covered for another minute.</li>
