        Bread Upma recipe is simple recipe to make and delicious to eat. At the end of a week, if you have very few ingredients left in your pantry and fridge, Bread Upma is the way to go. You can whip this up in less than 30 minutes and tastes great as it has the spicy flavour from the green chillies and ginger garlic paste and tanginess from the dash of lime that you add in the end.

    <h2>Steps to make Bread Upma</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin making the bread upma recipe, we will first toast the bread. You can toast it in your toaster or on a skillet.</li>
        <li>Once the bread is toasted, apply the softened butter over the toasted bread. Next cut the bread into small dices and keep aside.</li>
        <li>In a large wok or a kadai, heat 1 tablespoon of oil on medium heat and add in the mustard seeds. Allow the mustard seeds to crackle and add in the onions and green chillies. Saute the onions on medium heat, until soft and tender.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are soft, add in the tomatoes, curry leaves, turmeric powder and sambar powder. Stir and cook the tomatoes until they turn lightly soft as well.</li>
        <li>Finally add in the salt and the toasted buttered bread pieces. Stir well to combine all the ingredients and stir fry on medium to high heat for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>We stir fry just to make sure the bread pieces have got all the spices and salted well. Check salt levels. Remember the butter you used could have some salt as well.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped coriander leaves into the bread upma to get the delicious fresh flavour.</li>
        <li>Serve the Bread Upma Recipe for a healthy breakfast along with Papaya Banana Smoothie Recipe</li>
