# Odin Project: Basic Recipes Website
Welcome to the "Basic Recipes Website" project from The Odin Project's curriculum. In this project, I will be creating a straightforward yet engaging website to showcase a collection of my favorite recipes. By working on this project, I'll have the opportunity to put into practice the skills I've recently acquired, including using Bash for terminal operations, managing code with GitHub, and utilizing Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for coding in HTML.
